<h1>Personal Statement: Nicole Rivera</h1>

<p><strong>My Background</strong>
	I am a senior in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development studying Applied Psychology and Math/Computer Science originally from Long Island, New York. I do not have much previous IT or web development experience/coursework, but my favorite class that I have taken at BC was Computers in Management during my sophomore year.</p>

<p><strong>My Interest in Web Development</strong>
	I do not have any specific plans for future web development work as of right now, but I thought that gaining this experience would introduce me to new skills that I could bring to the workplace after I graduate.</p>

<p><strong>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies</strong>
	I am really involved in the Undergraduate Admissions Office at BC. I also love baseball (MLB), especially the Yankees.</p>

<p><strong>What I Hope to Gain from This Course</strong>
	I would like to learn as many new skills as possible that will hopefully help me stand out as a job applicant and/or working professional.</p>	

<p><strong>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About
	I would love to know coding basics
	Reading and designing websites</p>
