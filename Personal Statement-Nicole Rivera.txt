Personal Statement: Nicole Rivera 

My Background
	I am a senior in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development studying Applied Psychology and Math/Computer Science originally from Long Island, New York. I do not have much previous IT or web development experience/coursework, but my favorite class that I have taken at BC was Computers in Management during my sophomore year.

My Interest in Web Development 
	I do not have any specific plans for future web development work as of right now, but I thought that gaining this experience would introduce me to new skills that I could bring to the workplace after I graduate.

My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies
	I am really involved in the Undergraduate Admissions Office at BC. I also love baseball (MLB), especially the Yankees.

What I Hope to Gain from This Course
	I would like to learn as many new skills as possible that will hopefully help me stand out as a job applicant and/or working professional.	

Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About
I would love to know coding basics
Reading and designing websites
