<p> Being from Long Island, my favorite sports team is the New York Yankees. I would even argue that I was raised in a Yankee superfan household. The Yankees were established in 1901 and are currently based in the Bronx, competing in the MLB as a member of the American League East division. The Yankees have won a record 27 World Series Championships and are the second-highest valued sports franchise in the world. Some of my favorite players are CC Sabathia, Brett Gardner, Aaron Judge, and DJ LeMahieu. The Yankees did particularly well this past season and many people were convinced that they would win the world series. Their record was 103 and 59, and they scored 943 runs, with 6 walk off wins. However, they were unfortunately eliminated in the American League Championship series by the Houston Astros. The roster that they currently possess looks promising for years to come, but the biggest improvement the team could make would be the addition of a few stand out pitchers. Either way, I will still be supporting the Yankees, no matter their performance or records.</p>
