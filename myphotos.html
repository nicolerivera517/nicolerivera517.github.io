    <tr><td valign="top"><a href="https://nicolerivera517.github.io/images/vatican.jpg" style="color:gold;">Me in Vatican City:</a><br>Last April, my family and I spent time in Italy. Around Easter time, we went to Vatican City and spent time touring the Vatican (the Pope's primary residence). It was a beautiful and spiritual place with a lot of history and gorgeous artwork.</td><td valign="top"><a href="https://nicolerivera517.github.io/images/gameday.jpg" style="color:gold;"> Boston College GameDay:</a><br> One of my favorite things to do at BC is go to football games. Even though we are not the best team, everybody has so much fun at the games and it is a time when the entire Boston College community comes together.</td><td valign="top"><a href="https://nicolerivera517.github.io/images/amalfi.jpg" style="color:gold;">Amalfi, Italy:</a><br>I loved getting to experience the Amalfi Coast. This is a picture of the coastal town of Amalfi. We experienced beautiful weather, delicious food, and breathtaking views while we were there.</td></tr>
