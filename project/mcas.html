        <td valign="top"><a href="economics.html" style="color:gold;"> Economics</a><br>The economics major provides a critical examination of how the economic system works in the United States and throughout the world. The introductory courses are surveys of economic problems, policies, and theory; and the required courses in micro theory and macro theory give a deeper analytical foundation. Electives permit further study in a wide range of fields, including money and banking, international trade and finance, public sector economics, economic development, capital markets, inequality, industrial organization, environmental economics, and computational investing.
The economics major provides a general background that is useful to those planning careers in law, government service, or business as well as those planning careers as professional economists. Professional economists work as college teachers, as researchers for government agencies, businesses, and consulting firms, and as administrators and managers in a wide range of fields.</td>
        <td valign="top"><a href="biology.html" style="color:gold;">Biology</a><br>The Biology department considers a basic understanding of biological systems to be an essential skill in our increasingly technological society. The importance of research and experimentation in biology is stressed throughout the curriculum, which includes a strong focus on research experience through advanced labs and guided research on and off campus. 
The Biology Department offers a range of opportunities for undergraduate study. As a Biology major, students can obtain a Bachelor of Science in Biology or Biochemistry or a Bachelor of Arts in Biology. Biology majors may also choose to concentrate in Bioinformatics, which combines coursework in Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
For students interested in pursuing a health career, the department works with the Pre-Health office to create a plan of study and offer guidance in planning for graduate school programs and health-related careers. </td>
        <td valign="top"><a href="politicalscience.html" style="color:gold;">Political Science</a><br>An undergraduate major in Political Science provides a foundation for careers in politics, public administration, international service, law, business, and journalism, as well as a foundation for graduate work and teaching in the social sciences.</td></tr>
