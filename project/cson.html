        <td valign="top"><a href="nursing.html" style="color:gold;">Nursing</a><br>At the Connell School, students are members of the Boston College community: They enjoy all the benefits of a diverse liberal arts education while immersed in a campus culture that emphasizes intellectual inquiry and social justice. Our bachelor's program prepares students to practice as generalists in a range of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community agencies. The curriculum combines classroom learning with clinical experiences and includes essentials in nursing, the liberal arts, and the natural and social sciences. The degree takes four years, and we work with students to make the most of their time here through opportunities outside the classroomâ€”including Boston College athletics, student organizations, and international study and travel. In fact, a third of our students study abroad during their junior year and another third of senior students participate in global clinical experiences.</td>
