        <td valign="top"><a href="nursing.html" style="color:gold;"><h3 align="center">Nursing</h3></a><br>At the Connell School, students are members of the Boston College community: They enjoy all the benefits of a diverse liberal arts education while immersed in a campus culture that emphasizes intellectual inquiry and social justice. Our bachelor's program prepares students to practice as generalists in a range of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community agencies. The curriculum combines classroom learning with clinical experiences and includes essentials in nursing, the liberal arts, and the natural and social sciences. The degree takes four years, and we work with students to make the most of their time here through opportunities outside the classroom—including Boston College athletics, student organizations, and international study and travel. In fact, a third of our students study abroad during their junior year and another third of senior students participate in global clinical experiences.</td>
        <td valign="top">Teaching today’s diverse learners requires a broad knowledge base, complex problem solving, and critical reflection. A degree in Elementary Education from Boston College provides you with the total package of tools, skills, and resources to thrive as an educator. Our program features applied learning in many settings—public, private, parochial, and independent—and include bilingual, alternative, and special needs classrooms. Our practica and methods courses are closely linked so you’re always expanding your knowledge and practice.</td>
        <td valign="top">A degree in Secondary Education from Boston College is distinct. It combines innovative theoretical approaches with firsthand experience working with high school students. Here you’ll learn how to think critically about education, how to teach various disciplines, and how to connect those disciplines to facilitate learning—all while applying your knowledge in local schools and enhancing your experience with elective courses. You’ll round out your degree with a second major in English, history, mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, earth/environmental science, Spanish, Latin, or French—preparing you to teach in these subject areas. To focus your degree further, you can add a concentration in Special Education. When you graduate, you’ll be prepared to teach children in grades 8–12 in a variety of classrooms covering an array of subjects.</td></tr>
